# Hi, I’m Rob 👋

Frontend Engineer | React & TypeScript | UI-Focused Problem Solver

I’m a frontend-focused software engineer based in New Jersey with experience building modern, scalable web applications using React, TypeScript, and JavaScript.

I specialize in crafting clean, maintainable UI architectures, reusable component systems, and intuitive user experiences—often working in environments where performance, accessibility, and reliability are critical. My background also includes low-level development in C/C++, which gives me a strong foundation in performance-aware thinking and system design.

I enjoy bridging the gap between engineering rigor and polished user interfaces, and I’m especially interested in frontend roles where product quality, code clarity, and developer experience matter.
