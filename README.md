# Hi, I’m Rob 👋

Frontend Engineer | React & TypeScript | UI-Focused Problem Solver

I’m a frontend-savvy software engineer living in New Jersey with experience developing modern, scalable web apps using React, TypeScript, and JavaScript.

I have expertise in designing clean, maintainable UI architectures, component systems, and user experiences, often in environments where performance, accessibility, and reliability are paramount. My experience also includes low-level software development in C/C++, which provides me a solid grounding in performance-conscious thinking and system design.

I find it rewarding to connect engineering excellence with well-crafted user interfaces and am particularly interested in frontend engineering opportunities where product quality, code expressiveness, and developer experience are important.
