### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Rob, from New Jersey. I am mostly known as rob_loves_coding92 on Instagram. I've been sharing my coding journey since 2018 on there and my focus to inpire others to code as well. I really enjoy studying/woking with langauges like C++, Javacript, Typescript and a bit of Python.
